# math-core CLI

This is the command-line interface (CLI) for the [math-core library](https://crates.io/crates/math-core), a Rust-based converter that transforms LaTeX math expressions into the MathML Core format.

Once installed, you can use the `mathcore` command in your terminal. Use the `--help` flag to see available options and usage instructions:

A config file, `mathcore.toml` can be used to define custom LaTeX macros.

See the [main README](https://crates.io/crates/math-core) for more information about the project.
