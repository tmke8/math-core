# math-core-renderer-internal

This crate provides internal rendering functionalities for the `math-core` library. It is intended for use within the `math-core` ecosystem and is not meant for public consumption.

The version of this crate is kept in sync with that of `math-core` and does *not* follow SemVer itself. (`math-core` does follow SemVer, however.)
